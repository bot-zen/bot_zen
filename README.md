**minimally-deep learning approach to PoS tagging**


The bot.zen tagger combines a small assertion of trending techniques, which
implement matured methods, from natural language processing to achieve
competitive results on PoS tagging. This has been tested (so far) on
* [German CMC and Web corpus
  data](https://sites.google.com/site/empirist2015/)
* [POS tagging for Italian Social Media Texts](http://www.evalita.it/2016/tasks/postwita)

The code for the latter was a continuation of the code for the first ST, and
both versions are available as tags from this repository.
